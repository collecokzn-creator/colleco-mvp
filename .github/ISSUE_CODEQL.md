Summary:
- CodeQL run (ID: 19030085451) completed and SARIF uploaded during the merge of PR #46 (commit 1b805b05...).
- Found 2 raw diagnostic messages (processed and exported).

Details & links:
- CodeQL run: https://github.com/collecokzn-creator/colleco-mvp/actions/runs/19030085451
- Code scanning status: https://github.com/collecokzn-creator/colleco-mvp/security/code-scanning/tools/CodeQL/status/

Suggested triage steps:
1) Inspect the CodeQL SARIF via the GitHub Code Scanning UI and identify the two diagnostics.
2) For each diagnostic: add a short description, reproduce locally if possible, and decide: false positive / accept risk / fix required.
3) Assign to a backend/frontend owner and add appropriate labels.

Notes: issue created after automation merged PR #46 and verified CI.
