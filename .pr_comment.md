Summary of required reviewer actions:

- Rotate any exposed provider keys immediately (YOCO, VAPID, SMTP, OPENAI, Google Maps) if they were ever real.
- Review scripts/HISTORY_PURGE_PLAN.md for the suggested history-rewrite steps and coordinate before running.
- Verify CI secret scanning & push protections are enabled on main.
- Approve merging of this PR once rotation is confirmed; history-rewrite (if needed) should be executed after merging and coordination.

I can run the history-rewrite on a mirrored clone and prepare the force-push if you approve — I will not perform destructive changes without explicit confirmation and team coordination.
