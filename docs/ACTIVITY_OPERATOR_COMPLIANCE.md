## 5. Compliance Workflow

### 5.1 Initial Verification (New Partner)

```
Partner uploads documents → Azure OCR extraction → Automated validation →
  ├─ PASS: All documents valid, activity-instructor match → Approve listing
  ├─ FLAG: Minor issues (expiry soon, format unclear) → Admin review
  └─ REJECT: Critical issues (no instructor cert, insufficient insurance, equipment expired) → Partner notification
```

### 5.2 Automated Checks

1. **Document extraction** (Azure OCR, R0.027/doc)
2. **Activity risk grading** (Grade 1/2/3 based on declared activities)
3. **Instructor-activity matching** (scuba → PADI, climbing → MCSA, etc.)
4. **Insurance coverage validation** (Grade 1: R5M, Grade 2: R10M, Grade 3: R20M)
5. **First aid level check** (Grade 1: Level 1, Grade 2: Level 2, Grade 3: WFR)
6. **Equipment certificate matching** (bungee → cord test, scuba → tank test, etc.)
7. **Location-permit matching** (SANParks → SANParks permit, marine → DFFE permit)
8. **Group size calculation** (instructor count vs max clients per activity)

### 5.3 Annual Renewal Checks

- **90 days before expiry**: Email reminder (permits, insurance, equipment certs)
- **60 days before expiry**: Platform notification + listing flag
- **30 days before expiry**: Listing suspended for new bookings
- **Expiry date**: Listing delisted + existing bookings honored
- **30 days after expiry**: Full delisting

## 6. Common Mistakes & Red Flags

### 6.1 Common Mistakes

1. **Operating without adventure activity permit**
   - **Penalty**: R100,000 fine + criminal charges + business closure
   - **Fix**: Apply for provincial adventure permit (60-120 days)

2. **Insufficient public liability insurance**
   - Grade 3 activity (bungee, skydiving) with R5M coverage is inadequate
   - **Minimum**: R20M for high-risk activities
   - **Fix**: Upgrade insurance before listing

3. **Unqualified instructors**
   - Offering scuba diving without PADI Divemaster = criminal negligence
   - **Penalty**: R50,000 fine + R10M+ civil liability if injury/death
   - **Fix**: Hire qualified instructor OR send staff for certification

4. **Expired equipment inspection certificates**
   - Bungee cord not tested annually = equipment failure risk
   - **Penalty**: Criminal negligence if fatality + R10M+ civil liability
   - **Fix**: Annual equipment inspection (R500-5,000)

5. **Wrong first aid level**
   - High-risk activity (rafting) with basic first aid (Level 1) insufficient
   - **Requirement**: Wilderness First Responder (WFR) for Grade 3
   - **Fix**: Staff re-certification to WFR (R15,000, 10 days)

### 6.2 Auto-Reject Conditions

- ❌ Adventure activity permit expired → REJECT (illegal operation)

## 11. Integration Roadmap

### Phase 1: Manual Verification (Current)
- Partners upload PDF/JPG documents
- Admin reviews manually
- Binary approve/reject decision
- **Cost**: R0/month (manual labor intensive)

### Phase 2: Azure OCR + Automated Validation (Recommended)
- Install `@azure/ai-form-recognizer` SDK
- Extract text automatically
- Validate activity-instructor match
- Validate insurance coverage vs risk grade
- Validate first aid level vs activity risk
- Flag issues for admin review
- **Cost**: R30-73/month for 100 operators (95% automation)

### Phase 3: Certification Body APIs (Future)
- PADI API for scuba instructor verification (pending availability)
- MCSA API for climbing instructor verification (pending availability)
- PASA API for skydiving verification (pending availability)
- **Cost**: R0-20/month (mostly free or low-cost APIs)

### Phase 4: Real-Time Monitoring (Advanced)
- Webhook notifications when certifications expire
- Automatic reminder emails 90 days before expiry
- Listing auto-suspension on expiry
- Partner portal for renewal uploads
- **Cost**: R30-73/month + notification costs

## END OF ACTIVITY OPERATOR COMPLIANCE GUIDE

**Next steps**:
1. Install Azure Form Recognizer SDK: `npm install @azure/ai-form-recognizer`
2. Update `documentVerification.js` with activity-specific document types
3. Implement activity-instructor matching logic
4. Implement risk-grade validation (insurance, first aid level)
5. Test with sample activity operator documents
