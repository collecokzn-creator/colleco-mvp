# Shuttle Service Compliance Guide

## Overview

Shuttle services (airport transfers, hotel shuttles, corporate transport, point-to-point transfers) require **transport permits only** - no tourism licenses needed. This guide covers the exact documents required for shuttle operators.

---

## ✅ Required Documents for Shuttle Services

**Total Documents**: 10-15 (depending on fleet size and driver count)

---

### Transport-Specific Documents (5-10 required)

6. ✅ **Operating License** (Provincial Transport Authority)

   - Higher coverage than general liability
   - Cost to verify: R0.027
   
9. ✅ **Professional Driving Permit (PrDP)** - Per Driver (minimum 2-3 drivers)

10. ✅ **Vehicle Roadworthy Certificate (CoF)** - Per Vehicle (minimum 2-3 vehicles)
    - Annual renewal required
    - Cost to verify: R0.027 × 3 = R0.081
    
11. ✅ **Vehicle Registration Documents** - Per Vehicle
    - License disk and registration papers
    - Cost to verify: R0.027 × 3 = R0.081

**Subtotal**: R0.324 (9 docs for 3-vehicle operation)

---

### Optional Documents (only if applicable)

12. ⚠️ **Cross-Border Permit** (CBRTA)
   - **Only required if**: Doing airport shuttles to Botswana/Zimbabwe/Mozambique
   - **Not needed for**: Domestic shuttles only

---

## 🚫 Documents NOT Required for Shuttle Services

Unlike tour operators, shuttle services **do NOT need**:

- ❌ Tourist Transport Permit (TTP) - only for tourism activities
- ❌ Trade License (SATSA/TGCSA) - only for tour operators
- ❌ Tour Guide Registration - shuttles don't provide guiding
- ❌ FGASA Qualification - no wildlife/safari tours
- ❌ Language Certificates - not required for transport
- ❌ First Aid Certificate - drivers need valid licenses only
- ❌ Professional Indemnity Insurance - only for professional services (guides, consultants)

**Savings**: 7 fewer documents than tour operators = **R0.189 less per operator**

**What it covers**:
- Authorization to charge for passenger transport
- List of registered vehicles
- Passenger capacity per vehicle

**Note**: Most shuttle operators use 12-16 seater minibuses, requiring **Code C1 + PrDP**

---

### 4. Passenger Liability Insurance (R10M minimum)

**Why R10M (not R5M like general partners)**:
- Shuttles carry multiple passengers simultaneously
- Higher risk than single-client services
- Industry standard for passenger transport
- Required by Provincial Operating License Board

**What it covers**:
- Passenger injury or death
- Third-party property damage
- Legal liability
- Medical expenses per passenger
- Excess liability above minimum

**Typical policy structure**:
- Total coverage: R10,000,000
- Per passenger: R500,000
- Third-party property: R2,000,000
- Legal defense: R1,000,000

**Cost**: R3,000-10,000 per vehicle per year (depending on vehicle size, routes, claims history)

**Required details on certificate**:
- Policy number
- Insurer name (Santam, Hollard, Old Mutual, etc.)
- Coverage amount (total and per passenger)
- List of all vehicles on policy
- Effective and expiry dates

**Important**: All vehicles on Operating License and PrDP **must be listed** on insurance policy

---

### 5. Vehicle Roadworthy Certificate (CoF)

**Required for**: Every vehicle on the PrDP

**Validity**: 12 months for commercial vehicles (60 days for new registration)

**What's tested**:
- Brakes, steering, suspension
- Lights, indicators, reflectors
- Tyres (minimum 1.6mm tread depth)
- Windscreen, wipers, mirrors
- Seatbelts (one per seat, must be functional)
- Emergency equipment (fire extinguisher, warning triangle)
- Vehicle structure integrity (no rust, damage)

**How to get**:
1. Book appointment at authorized vehicle testing station
2. Bring vehicle with all safety equipment
3. Test takes 30-60 minutes
4. Certificate issued immediately if passed
5. Retest within 21 days if failed

**Cost**: R500-800 per vehicle

**Renewal**: Annual for commercial vehicles

**Note**: Roadworthy expires faster than driver's license - track carefully!

---

### 6. Vehicle Registration Documents

**Required documents per vehicle**:
- License disk (renewed annually)
- Registration certificate (vehicle ownership proof)
- Proof of owner matching business registration

**Why important**:
- Verifies business owns/leases vehicles legally
- Matches vehicle to Operating License and PrDP
- Confirms license disk is current
- Cross-checks with insurance policy

**Common issues**:
- Vehicle registered to director personally (not business) ⚠️
- License disk expired ❌
- Vehicle on permit but not registered ❌
- Leased vehicle without proper lease agreement ⚠️

**Best practice**: Register all shuttle vehicles under business name (Pty Ltd)

---

## Automated Verification Workflow

### Step 1: Document Upload

Shuttle operator uploads via **PartnerVerification** page:
- Business registration, tax clearance, banking, ID
- Operating License
- PrDP Permit
- Passenger Liability Insurance
- Driver PrDP licenses (per driver)
- Vehicle roadworthy certificates (per vehicle)
- Vehicle registration documents (per vehicle)

### Step 2: Azure OCR Extraction (R0.027/doc)

For each document:
- Extract permit numbers, expiry dates, vehicle lists, driver names
- Parse routes, passenger capacity, coverage amounts
- Flag expired or expiring-soon documents (within 60 days)

### Step 3: Automated Cross-Validation

**Vehicle List Consistency**:
```
Operating License vehicles: [CA 123456, CA 654321, CA 111222]
PrDP Permit vehicles:       [CA 123456, CA 654321, CA 111222] ✅
Insurance Policy vehicles:  [CA 123456, CA 654321] ❌ Missing CA 111222
Roadworthy Certificates:    [CA 123456, CA 654321, CA 111222] ✅
Registration Documents:     [CA 123456, CA 654321, CA 111222] ✅
```
**Result**: Flag insurance mismatch → Admin review required

**Driver Authorization**:
```
Driver: John Smith (ID 8501015800080)
PrDP License: Code C1 (12-16 seater minibus)
Vehicle assigned: CA 123456 (16-seater Toyota Quantum) ✅

Driver: Jane Doe (ID 9001015800081)
PrDP License: Code B (light motor vehicle)
Vehicle assigned: CA 654321 (16-seater minibus) ❌ Invalid category
```
**Result**: Flag driver-vehicle mismatch → Admin review required

**Route Authorization**:
```
Operating License routes: "OR Tambo Airport - Sandton - Pretoria CBD"
Advertised services: "Airport transfers, Sandton shuttles, Pretoria corporate transport, Kruger Park tours"
```
**Result**: Kruger Park not authorized → Flag for route amendment OR remove from listings

### Step 4: Government API Verification

**CIPC API** (FREE):
- Verify business registration number
- Check company status (Active/Deregistered)
- Confirm directors match ID documents

**eNaTIS API** (if access granted):
- Verify vehicle registration numbers
- Check license disk validity
- Confirm owner matches business registration

### Step 5: Admin Review Dashboard

**AdminPartnerVerification** shows:

✅ **Auto-Accepted** (all checks passed):
- All documents valid and not expiring soon
- Vehicle lists match across all documents
- Driver PrDP categories match vehicle types
- Insurance covers all vehicles
- Routes authorized for advertised services

⚠️ **Pending Review** (manual verification needed):
- Documents expiring within 30-60 days
- Minor vehicle list mismatches (e.g., one vehicle missing from insurance)
- Driver PrDP category borderline (e.g., Code B for small shuttle)
- Routes need amendment for new services

❌ **Auto-Rejected** (critical failures):
- Expired Operating License or PrDP
- Driver without PrDP operating shuttle
- Vehicle without roadworthy certificate
- Insurance expired or insufficient coverage (below R10M)
- Vehicle on permit not owned/registered to business

**Admin actions**:
- Accept (override auto-decision)
- Reject with reason (email operator)
- Request resubmission of specific documents
- Conditionally approve (e.g., "Update insurance by [date]")
- Add notes for future renewals

## Compliance Checklist for Admins

### Before Approving Shuttle Operator:

- [ ] Operating License valid and not expired
- [ ] Operating License routes include all advertised services
- [ ] PrDP Permit valid and not expired
- [ ] All vehicles on Operating License match PrDP Permit

- [ ] Insurance coverage ≥ R10M (not R5M)
- [ ] Each driver has valid PrDP for correct vehicle category
- [ ] All drivers listed on PrDP Permit
- [ ] All roadworthy certificates valid (not expired)
- [ ] All license disks valid (check vehicle registration docs)
- [ ] Business registered and tax compliant
- [ ] Banking details verified

### Red Flags (Auto-Reject or Escalate):

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Confusing General Liability with Passenger Liability Insurance

❌ **Wrong**: "I have R5M public liability insurance"  
✅ **Correct**: "I need R10M passenger liability insurance PLUS R5M general liability"

**Why**: Passenger liability is transport-specific, higher risk coverage

---

### 2. Operating on Unapproved Routes

❌ **Wrong**: Operating License says "OR Tambo - Sandton" but doing "Cape Town - Stellenbosch"  
✅ **Correct**: Apply for route amendment before operating new routes

**Penalty**: R50,000 fine and vehicle impoundment

---

### 3. Driver Without PrDP

❌ **Wrong**: Driver has Code C1 license (thinks that's enough)  
✅ **Correct**: Driver needs Code C1 **+ PrDP endorsement**

**Penalty**: R5,000 fine per driver, business liable

---

### 4. Expired Roadworthy Certificate

❌ **Wrong**: "My roadworthy is 13 months old, still valid for 2 years"  
✅ **Correct**: Commercial vehicles need annual roadworthy renewal

**Penalty**: Cannot operate until renewed, potential insurance claim rejection

---

### 5. Vehicle Not on Insurance Policy

❌ **Wrong**: 3 vehicles on permit, only 2 on insurance (to save money)  
✅ **Correct**: ALL vehicles on permit MUST be on insurance

**Risk**: Uninsured vehicle in accident = personal liability (millions)
