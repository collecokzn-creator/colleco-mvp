## Automated Verification Workflow for Tour Guides

### Step 1: Guide Profile Creation

Tour guide creates profile via **PartnerVerification** page:
- Personal details (name, ID, contact)
- Guide registration details (number, level, areas)
- Languages spoken
- Specializations (adventure, cultural, wildlife, etc.)
- Upload documents

### Step 2: Document Upload & OCR

Guide uploads:
1. Tourist Guide Registration Certificate
2. ID Document / Passport
3. First Aid Certificate
4. Police Clearance (not older than 12 months)
5. Professional Indemnity Insurance
6. Language certificates (if applicable)
7. Specialist qualifications (FGASA, diving, climbing, etc.)
8. Driver's license (if driver-guide)
9. Vehicle documents (if using own vehicle)

**Azure OCR** extracts:
- Registration number and level
- Expiry dates
- ID number verification
- Language proficiencies
- Specialist certifications

### Step 3: Automated Validation

**Registration Certificate**:

- Check registration status (active/suspended/revoked)
- Confirm guide level and areas of operation
- Validate annual renewal status

**Cost**: Likely FREE or minimal fee per lookup

### Step 5: Cross-Validation

**Guide claiming wildlife/safari tours**:
- ❌ No FGASA qualification → Flag for review
- ✅ FGASA Level 2 + valid registration → Auto-approve

**Guide claiming adventure activities**:
- ❌ Only basic first aid → Flag for review (needs WFR)
- ❌ No specialist certification for claimed activity → Reject
- ✅ WFR + climbing/diving/rafting cert → Auto-approve

**Guide claiming multilingual tours**:
- ❌ No language certificates → Flag for review
- ✅ DELF B2 French + Goethe B2 German → Auto-approve

### Step 6: Admin Review Dashboard

**AdminPartnerVerification** shows:

- ⚠️ **Pending Review**:
  - Police clearance with minor offenses (traffic fines, etc.)
  - Expiring certificates (30-60 days)
  - Missing specialist certs for claimed services
  - Language proficiency claims without certificates
- ❌ **Auto-Rejected**:
