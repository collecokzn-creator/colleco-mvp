## Automated Verification Workflow

### Step 1: Document Upload (Partner Self-Service)

Partner uploads all required documents via **PartnerVerification** page:
- Standard documents (business reg, tax, insurance, ID, banking)
- Transport-specific documents (operating license, permits, driver licenses, roadworthy certs)

### Step 2: Azure OCR Extraction (R0.027/doc)

For each document:
- Extract all text using Azure Form Recognizer
- Parse permit numbers, expiry dates, vehicle registrations, names
- Flag documents with:
  - ❌ Expired or expiring within 60 days
  - ❌ Missing required fields (e.g., no permit number)
  - ❌ Low confidence OCR (blurry, damaged documents)

### Step 3: Cross-Document Validation

**Vehicle List Validation**:
```
Operating License vehicles: [CA 123456, CA 654321, CA 111222]
PrDP Permit vehicles:       [CA 123456, CA 654321, CA 111222] ✅
Insurance Policy vehicles:  [CA 123456, CA 654321] ❌ Missing CA 111222
Roadworthy Certificates:    [CA 123456, CA 654321, CA 111222] ✅
```
**Result**: Flag mismatch → Admin review required

**Driver Authorization Validation**:
```
Driver: John Smith (ID 8501015800080)
PrDP Category: C1 (12-16 seater minibus)
Vehicle assigned: CA 123456 (16-seater Toyota Quantum) ✅

Driver: Jane Doe (ID 9001015800081)
PrDP Category: Code B (light motor vehicle)
Vehicle assigned: CA 654321 (16-seater minibus) ❌ Invalid category
```
**Result**: Flag mismatch → Admin review required

**Route Authorization Validation**:
```
Operating License routes: "OR Tambo Airport - Sandton - Pretoria"
Advertised services: "Airport transfers, Sandton shuttles, Pretoria tours, Kruger Park tours"
```
**Result**: Kruger Park not authorized → Flag for route amendment

### Step 4: Government API Verification (Where Available)

**CIPC API** (FREE):
- Verify business registration number
- Check company status (Active/Deregistered)
- Confirm directors match ID documents

**eNaTIS API** (if access granted):
- Verify vehicle registration numbers
- Check license disk validity
- Confirm owner matches business registration

**SARS eFiling** (if integrated):
- Verify tax clearance status
- Check tax number validity

### Step 5: Admin Review Dashboard

**AdminPartnerVerification** page shows:
- ✅ **Auto-Accepted** (95% confidence, all checks passed)
- ⚠️ **Pending Review** (60-95% confidence or flagged mismatches)
  - Cross-validation warnings
  - Expiring-soon documents (30-60 days)
  - Low OCR confidence areas
- ❌ **Auto-Rejected** (<60% confidence or critical failures)
  - Expired documents
  - Missing required fields
  - Failed government API checks

**Admin actions**:
- Accept (override auto-decision)
- Reject with reason (email partner)
- Request resubmission of specific documents
- Add notes for future reference
